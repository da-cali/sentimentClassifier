# sentimentClassifier

A vanilla Naive Bayes classifier that tells you whether or not you are saying something nice.

Like this:

```bash
Tell me something...
love
That is nice.
Tell me something...
hate
That is not nice.
Tell me something...
homework
That is nice.
Tell me something...
homework on friday
That is not nice.
```
